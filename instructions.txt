== building / running info ==

Editing src/T9A1/server/db_config.txt will allow you to change which database the server connects to: the current setup will still be in place for the time being.

An ant build file is provided to compile the client and server. Executing "ant dist" will compile everything and place the client and server jar files in dist/.  The dist/resources/ directory is part of the client - keep in mind when moving.

To run the server, move to the dist/ directory and execute "java -jar T9A1-server-[date].jar".
To run the client, move to the dist/ directory and execute "java -jar T9A1-client-[date].jar [store # of this kiosk client]".


== troubleshooting ==

-Make sure that the database is working and the server is configured to connect to it properly.  Error messages should point in the right direction.
-Remember to use the store number when starting the client.
